# Unofficial Dualis Python API Wrapper

A Third-Party Python API Wrapper for [https://dualis.dhbw.de/](https://dualis.dhbw.de/)

## Usage

```python
import dualis

# initialize and login

test = dualis.Dualis("email", "pass")

# or login later:

test = dualis.Dualis()
test.login("email","pass")

# get parsed information

print(test.getExamResults())
print(test.getNewMessages())
print(test.getPerformance())
print(test.getTimeTable())
print(test.getTodayEvents())
print(test.getExamResults())
...
```

## Why do I need it?

If you want to create an application like a mobile app, chatbot, website or something else in python, you can use this module to easily receive parsed information (like your timetable) to implement it in your application.  
This module is great if you want to start programming with python and want to learn about APIs.

## Intentions

This module was created with good intentions behind it, for example:

- Learning to code with Python
- Learning to work with APIs and modules
- Implementing timetables or other information in own applications

Please do not abuse this project to harm the original website in any way.  
I am not responsible for any harm caused with this project. Please use this API wrapper with caution and do not spam request the Dualis Server.

## Todo

- Implement more Endpoints
- Better, more precise Parsing
- Make Return values more readable
- Documentation

Please Contribute if you can.  
When project is finished, a pip package will be created

## Contributing

I can not parse information from the website completely, because i do not have full access to timetables and other information.  
If you have a completed timetable with many appointments, please contribute to this project to make the parsing more precise.
